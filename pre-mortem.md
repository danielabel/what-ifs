# Asking ‘What if?’: a pre-mortem game

##  Purpose

This session is aimed at a cross functional group developing a service. It's
designed to help the group explore the development, maintenance and operational
requirements.

The most important point of the session is to have a conversation about the
wider system needs with the right people in the room who can respond to the
discoveries of the session.

## Activity overview

The activity involves asking a group to first sketch out a future timeline of
their service. Then to discover likely exposure to critical risks and what
should be done.

It will be a mixture of reality: what they know, and fantasy: what might happen.

Before starting, the group needs make clear which project they are going to be
examining and how long into the future they are going to look. My default
duration would be between 3 - 6 months. I recommend, at minimum, the timeline
should include releasing to real users, ideally more than once.

## Equipment needed

You’ll need a big white board, the set of [What-If](https://rawgit.com/danielabel/what-ifs/master/what-ifs-remark-deck.html)
slides printed out. A flip-chart, plus paper and pens. I prefer file-cards and
sharpies.

### Step 1. Draw the future timeline

Draw out a timeline onto the whiteboard. Start from today on the left and and
stretch out across the board to your chosen future date. I like to split up
the timeline into the months it includes so everyone can see the time passing.

Working with the group, mark on the time line:

1.  Calendar events: mark down well known dates to give people context.

2.  External project events. Ask for the events that are upcoming: launches,
    promotions, releases. Often a powerful indicator for a service in
    development is the level and ramp up of users expected on the service.

3.  Internal project events. Is there stuff going on with the team or the wider
    business that’s worth noting? Are there holidays, events?

4.  Ask what dates or events are critical and why - mark on
    the board.

5.  Are there any other constraints we should note?

### Step 2. Warm up the what-if engine

Give the group file-cards and sharpies.

 - Ask them to write down the best headlines they would like to see after a
    launch or release.
 - Ask them to write down the worst headlines they could see after launch

Whilst they are doing this, draw out grid of Impact and Likelihood.

With the group, find the right places for the 'worst headline' cards on to the
map.

### Step 3. Mine for risks

Divide into a couple of groups - 3 people each ideally. Each subgroup should
cross discipline and have a technical member. Hand each group some What-If
slides - 5 is good.

Ask them to think what needs to be done to deal with each the event or challenge
for a minute.

Including:
1. How big would be impact be if it happened.
2. How likely the group thinks it is.

Ask them to write on the back of the page the risk and the details. Who might
owns it, and who can help.

Ask them to be ready to report back to the group in 10 minutes.

### Step 4. Share and Collate result

Get the groups to share their thoughts and capture the urgency and mitigations
and solutions.

Write headline file-cards for the issues/risks they come up with and stick them
on the Impact/Likelyhood board

#### Ask the wider group

1. Do other people have input or perspectives?
2. Are there actions to be taken?
3. Ask for an owner for this risk - who is going to help?

If the group is unsure about likelihood, ask them to use  what they know now.

### Step 5. Iterate.

Repeat step 3 & 4 until all the cards have been discussed.

### Step 6. Summarise

Ask:
- What have we learnt?
- What actions should be taken?
- What’s most important?
- What's going to change?
- What don’t we know?

Show that we’ve identified some key risks that may not be managed by story based
development alone.
