# What if?

A collection of resources to challenge our thinking about what we need our
digital services to do. To help us to see the software and infrastructure
needed to help manage business risk.

## Why?
Many projects have a good grip on the functional requirements - the view of the
likely user needs are shared across a cross disciplined group which collaborates
to discover and build a service.

However the Cross (or Non) Functional Requirements - the requirements that
support the user needs at scale - often get forgotten, ignored or not valued.

I feel that, like the functional requirements, the Cross Functional Requirements
should be understood and owned by a wide group, so I started making less
statements and asking different, less technical focused, questions so we can all
prioritise and plan together.

## A set of questions
[The deck](https://rawgit.com/danielabel/what-ifs/master/what-ifs-remark-deck.html)
presents the set of a set of questions we should ask when developing a new
service or replacing an existing one.

It's written in [Remark](http://remarkjs.com/) and can be viewed through a
browser or printed.

## A Pre-mortum workshop
The workshop is a use of the set of questions to explore the cross-functional
needs of a project by looking into the near future. Asking ourselves what's
going to happen, what might happen and what do we need to do to manage the
impact and risk well.
