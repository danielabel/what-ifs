# What if?

A collection of resources to challenge our thinking about what we need our
digital services to do. To help us to see the software and infrastructure
needed to help manage business risk.

## Why?
Many projects have a good grip on the functional requirements. These user needs 
are shared across a cross disciplined group which can then collaborate
to discover and build a service.

The Cross (or Non) Functional Requirements - the requirements that
support the user needs at scale - often get forgotten, ignored or not valued.

Like the functional requirements, the Cross Functional Requirements
should be understood and owned by a wide group.

I've started making less statements and asking different, less technical focused, 
questions so we can all prioritise and plan together.

## How?

### questions (to start conversations)
[These slides](https://danielabel.github.io/what-ifs/what-ifs-remark-deck.html)
present a set of questions that are worth asking when developing a new service
or replacing an existing one. I've written open questions without technical
jargon, with a view of starting as wide a conversation as possible.

It's written in [Remark](http://remarkjs.com/) and should be easily viewed
through most browsers. (It seems to also behave well when printed, but let me
know if other formats would be useful.)

I'm sure they aren't complete, or perfect. How about a fork and a pull request?

### workshop

Look into the near future, using this set of questions to explore the
cross-functional needs of a project. Ask what's likely to happen and 
explore what we will need to do to manage the impact and risk.

This [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/danabel3390/m/danabel3390/1656277711453/e939f63c7b5c51f3c253249f4215e486b4be1a46?sender=u2fa2e5c9731a4f09008a5755) lays out the structure for a discovery session.

Gather as a group, ensure everyone is aware of the work to be discussed, pick 3 cards and begin!
